# SoundboardApp
A soundboard app similar to Voicemod, but free - created as a project to learn ElectronJS and NodeJS with.

## Features

The interface is quite simple;

You can add new sounds by clicking the + button when in soundboard mode.
You can delete sounds when switching to the Delete mode by clicking the top right red Delete button (click on "Soundboard" to go back to soundboard mode).
You can set keybinds (don't set Ctrl+I since this opens the Dev tools) by clicking on "Add keybind" under the sound.
You can change the play mode (chaos mode - play sounds at the same time / sequential mode - play only one sound at a time) by clicking the green button in the top right corner.
You can change the app theme (light mode or dark mode).

## Other notes

If anyone knows how to be able to stream audio through a (virtual) microphone using NodeJS then feel free to create a pull request or fork the project. 
I tried looking up how to do this but couldn't figure it out. Have fun!
