# SoundboardApp
A soundboard app similar to Voicemod, but free - previously created as a project to learn ElectronJS and NodeJS with. It has now been rebuilt with (tauri)[https://tauri.app/].

## Features

The interface is quite simple;

You can add new sounds by clicking the + button.
You can delete sounds by clicking on the trash can.
You can set keybinds (don't set Ctrl+I since this opens the Dev tools) by clicking on "Add keybind" under the sound.
You can change the app theme (light mode or dark mode).

## Other notes

Currently trying to make the sound work while the app is not focused (through rust).
