# SoundboardApp
A soundboard app similar to Voicemod, but free - previously created as a project to learn ElectronJS and NodeJS with. It has now been rebuilt with (tauri)[https://tauri.app/], Svelte and TailwindCSS as a way to reduce the app's size, and learn those technologies.

## Features

The interface is quite simple;

You can add new sounds by clicking the + button.
You can delete sounds by clicking on the trash can.
You can set keybinds by clicking on "Add keybind" under the sound.
You can change the playback mode (chaos mode - play multiple sounds at the same time or sequential - when playing a sound, stop all previous ones).
You can change the app theme (light mode or dark mode).

## Other notes

I have no idea how to create drivers to be able to stream the audio through a microphone, but I will try my best.
